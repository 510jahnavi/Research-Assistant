## 🔁 Restoring Deployment from ZIP (After Vercel Project Deletion)

If you've deleted your Vercel deployment but still have the full code downloaded from v0.dev as a ZIP file, follow these steps to redeploy using GitHub:

### 1. 🔓 Extract the ZIP
Unzip the downloaded file from v0.dev. Ensure it contains files like:

```
app/
components/
public/
package.json
tailwind.config.ts
...
```

> ✅ The `app/page.tsx` file must exist — it's required for Next.js App Router projects.

---

### 2. 🚀 Initialize a Git Repository

Open a terminal and navigate to the unzipped project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/unzipped-folder
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from v0 zip"
```

---

### 3. 🗂️ Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository (e.g., `music_website`)
3. **Do not initialize with a README**

---

### 4. 🔗 Push Code to GitHub

Connect your local folder to the new GitHub repo:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/music_website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. 🌐 Redeploy on Vercel

1. Visit [https://vercel.com/import](https://vercel.com/import)
2. Click “Import Git Repository”
3. Select your GitHub repo (`music_website`)
4. Vercel will auto-detect it as a Next.js project → click **Deploy**

✅ Your site will be live again with a new `.vercel.app` URL!
